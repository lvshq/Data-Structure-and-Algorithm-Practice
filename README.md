# Data-Structure-and-Algorithm-Practice
Questions and corresponding codes when learning and practicing data structure and algorithm.

Each file consists of the question description and the code I wrote. The commits explaining the thought are also included.

The questions mainly come from the assignments of my subject and some online judge such as soj and poj.
