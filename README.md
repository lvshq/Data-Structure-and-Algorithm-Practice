# Data-Structure-and-Algorithm-Practice
Questions and corresponding codes when learning and practicing data structure and algorithm.

Each file consists of the question description and the code I wrote. The commits explaining the thought are also included.

The questions mainly come from:

1.The assignments of my data structure and algorithm subject, many of which belong to A.Prof Pan Yan's TAs assignments.

2.Some online judge websites such as SOJ and POJ.
